## Instructions

> **NOTE** We add the fat and knead before we add the watery parts,
> so the fat coats the flour, and thus prevents the water
> from making the flour form clumps.

1. Soak the sabza in warm water for 5min, keep separate for now\

1. Bake without circulating air, as for your liking:
	- 7min - 10min : This rather dries then bakes the cookies, meaning they will be bright and a bit soft
	- 15min : they will be a bit brown\
