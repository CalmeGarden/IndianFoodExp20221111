A very popular and nutritious dish, which can be a whole meal on its own.

At AhimsaGram, we used to use black chickpeas as the daal (they are small).

main:

- 200 g daal (any kind, e.g. black chickpeas)
- onions
- coriander leafs

- coriander seeds

- ginger
- peanuts, roasted
- (optional) oil
- (optional) pinch of [hing (asafoetida)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asafoetida)

- cauliflower

1. Add and roast the onions
1. Add and roast the ginger, turmeric and coriander seeds

   (we need it watery anyway at this point, and the tomatoes water is miner one,
   and so we want to keep that)

1. (optional) Mix the hing with a bit of hot water and put it into the main pan
